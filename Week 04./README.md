# Week 4.
In week 4 we began with a strong focus on processing and how to upload photos and type. We experimented with a photo of our choice creating a 'pointillising' that allowed the photo to be replicated but made out of a series of shapes. We uploaded type and learnt how to create our very own spinning text effect. 

We also dedicated quite alot of time to discussing ideas for our pitches the ideas I presented were: <br/>
### Covid Flower Populator
A webbased space that contains a vase that populates with flowers relative to the amount of covid cases Aus.
### Goldfish Tracking Drawing
A plotting machine that uses computer vision to track my goldfish movement and produces it onto paper. 
### Bike Paintjob Generator
A generator to choose what style/colours to paint your bike based on your individual riding characterisitcs. 
### Personalised Typeface Generator
A typeface generator that creates you your very own type face based on your answers to a series of personal questions. <br/>

After a series of discussions with Karen, Andy and a few of my class mates I came to the decision that I wanted to persue the Tpeface Generator idea. The idea of choosing a topic in an area that you would like to learn about had been pushed alot throughout the discussions so I decided that generative type was the way to go as my interest in this area has been growing week by week.<br/>
