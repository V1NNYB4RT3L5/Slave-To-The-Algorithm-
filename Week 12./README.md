# Week 12.
In week 12 we spent the first half of the class making sure our submissions were ready for the launch of our SlaveToTheAlgoithm online exhibit, including a great tutorial on how to make an animated GIF in photoshop by Andy. By the end of lunch [the site](https://karenanndonnachie.github.io/Slave-To-The-Algorithm/Slave_ribbon/) was live. Everyones work was complete at such a high standard and it was so exciting to see the developments that had been made in the final weeks. The launch was followed by a strange yet very emotional goodbye </3. 

# MyType - The Process. 
**[Week 5.](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2005.)**/**[Week 6.](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2006.)**<br/>

Following the Project Pitch Asessment I decided to pursue my idea of creating a typeface generator gathering its parameters from a series of personal questions. I began my research looking into systems that create large amounts of unique outcomes, and  generative typographers. ***Click Week 5/6 to read more...***

**[Week 7.](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2007.)**<br/>

Following my research I was inspired by the use of grids as the base of a template to a series of different outcomes and I created a paper prototype for my proposed generator. I also was introduced to the Geomerative library. ***Click Week 7 to read more...***

**[Week 8.](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2008.)**<br/>

I took the next step of turning my system into pseudo code which lead to ideas regarding how to store the amount of information that will be needed in my proposed system. I looked into Geomerative library examples and began looking into the user experience of my system. ***Click Week 8 to read more...***

**[Week 9.](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2009.)**<br/>

I presented my progress for a milestone review and was introduced to new functions to assist with the survey part of my system and also textToPoints. I then moved my system to P5.js and began implementing textToPoints. ***Click Week 9 to read more...***

**[Week 10.](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2010.)**<br/>

I developed my use of textToPoints to a point where I was ready to begin merging my letter forms. I developed the sketch to the point of being a prospective view of the final function and then began working in a seperate sketch on how to merge my letter forms; combing textToPoints and begin/endShape. ***Click Week 10 to read more...***

**[Week 11.](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2011.)**<br/>

I had my final chat with Karen and Andy where I was directed on how to use my final week. I began refining the design side of things whilst also combining my letter merging sketch with my survey sketch. ***Click Week 11 to read more...***
