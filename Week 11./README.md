# Week 11.
### Final WIP.
In Week 11 class I presented my 2 sketches that I worked in in [week 10](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%2010.) showing the updated user experience in one and the merging of letters in the other. 

Andy pushed me to focus on the design side of things as up to this point my focus had only been on the function of it all. Things like typography and use of space were talked about and he gave me a link to a similar system that he liked the look of https://www.eliashanzer.com/phase/. 

I then spoke with Karen who was interested in me completing the function of my generator, and encouraged me that it was not as hard to merge my 2 sketches as I thought. She noticed that at the moment more than 1 answer to each question could be selected and directed me to use [createRadio](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createRadio) which would only allow one answer. My next step was to merge my sketch combining the letter forms with my sketch of how the generator should function. 

### Finishing touches.
After applying the createRadio function the idea became a whole lot more achievable. Using what I had found with the beginShape function I gave each possible radio option an outcome that drew a specific section of a letter meaning that once all questions were answered a hybrid letter is formed. Following Andy's advice of approaching the layout in a more minimal way I was not only able to create a more visually pleasing display but it also allowed me to focus on screen size sensitivity which I had been having issues with until now.  <br/>

### My Statement 

There is great diversity amongst human beings. A similar diversity is present in the characters of our alphabets that can be manipulated into countless different typefaces. MyType offers the opportunity for people to reflect their individuality through the medium of typography. It is an interactive typeface generator that determines its parameters on the basis of answers to a survey of personal questions input by the user. One pre-existing typeface is correlated with each possible answer, and each question is aligned with one segment of the new letter form. On completion of the survey the user has created a hybrid piece of typography which reflects their responses. MyType has been created in Processing using the p5.js core library DOM, and utilises a variety of renowned typefaces by typographers such as Paul Renner, Howard Kettler and other notable designers. This product is the culmination of my interest in typography and particularly the creation of abstract letter forms. MyType creates the opportunity for people not usually interested in typography to design their own typeface. The Future directions for this product include the addition of further variation to the possible outcomes by incorporating more questions and more refined answers with the view to making the personalised typefaces downloadable.
