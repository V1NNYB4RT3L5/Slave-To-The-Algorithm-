# Week 7.
### Paper Prototype and discussion.
After seeing the use of grids everywhere in my research I went on to create a **paper prototype** of my system, representing the procedure of answers being allocated to typefaces, typefaces being called upon based on the users answers, typefaces being stacked evenly upon a grid, and then each pixel within that grid randomly allocating a typeface from the stack to represent. <br/>

Michael, Louis and Karen were extremely helpful and gave me a few ideas for where to go next with the process of creating my typeface generator. <br/>
- SVG to processing/ identify anchor points of all possible typefaces then randomly select anchorpoints and combine to create each character.

- Breziers to connect anchor points with a clean curve.

I also recieved a link from Karen to Geomerative - http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/ - a library created to facilitate process of making generative typography and shapes in Processing. 
    
### Talk about Github becoming our website
[Useful video](https://pages.github.com/) showing how we can make our githubs visible on a public domain.
### Stuff to learn/reference 
https://p5js.org/libraries/ <br/>

### Processing - Wiggly letters. 
This weeks task involved classes, which I still do not understand so I will get back to writing about this weeks processing.
