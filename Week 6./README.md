# Week 6. 
This week we began by gathering ourselves into groups and working out whose projects were similar whose. I began in the typography group but due to a lack of people in it I had a look into the web group that will have a focus on using p5.js which will be useful to me as I aim for my typeface generator to be a web based platform. We then had a look into paper prototyping and the importance of it in the early stages of idea development to get a very simple yet clear understand of the mechanics behind an idea. And finally we had a processing class where we learnt how to import sound, start and stop it using mouse click and also visualise the varying levels of its volume. 

## Paper Prototyping.
My group worked on creating a paper prototype for Space invaders. <br/>
