# Week 6. 
This week we began by gathering ourselves into groups and working out whose projects were similar whose. I began in the typography group but due to a lack of people in it I had a look into the web group that will have a focus on using p5.js which will be useful to me as I aim for my typeface generator to be a web based platform. We then had a look into paper prototyping and the importance of it in the early stages of idea development to get a very simple yet clear understand of the mechanics behind an idea. And finally we had a processing class where we learnt how to import sound, start and stop it using mouse click and also visualise the varying levels of its volume. 

## Paper Prototyping.
My group worked on creating a paper prototype for Space invaders. <br/>

## Processing. 
## Inspo recieved from Louis. 
[Shape Grammers](https://www.slanted.de/product/shape-grammars/) by Jannis Maroscheck - *'Based on the work of Sol LeWitt, graphic designer Jannis Maroscheck has designed and programmed his own production systems that can draw an unlimited number of individual graphic shapes.'* This links directly to my work with the typeface generator as it focuses on creating unique outcomes, along with this he also explores the use of grids, in an example shown below a noise is generated by black and white pixels on an 11x11 grid, that pixel cloud is then smoothed to generate a shape.
