# Week 9.
This week we began with a milestone review of where we were all at with our final projects. I presented my prototype that I shared in [Week 8](https://github.com/V1NNYB4RT3L5/Slave-To-The-Algorithm-/tree/master/Week%208.). I was introduced to the [button function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createButton) in P5.js by Chantel, leading me to realise that so far my code was not written as efficiently as it could be. <br/>

After our consultations with the class we then moved on to looking at a few different examples in processing, one that I was particularly interested in after Karen had sent it my direction was [TextToPoints](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Font/textToPoints); a way of taking text and plotting points along the outline of the individual letters. This was exciting to see as it made the idea of combining pre-exisiting letter forms seem a little bit more achievable. <br/>

## MyType Progress. 
After some help from Karen with textToPoints and a look into the various ways of selecting options in P5.js such as buttons, sliding bars and checked boxes I have began building the MyType layout in P5.js. Issues I am having at the moment are... <br/>
. textToPoints not listening to textAlign so letter outlines are not stacking on top of one another from the centre. <br/>
. Differing letter height, even tho textSize is the same each letter has their own size. <br/>
