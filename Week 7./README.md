# Week 7.
### Paper Prototype and discussion.
Michael, Louis and Karen were extremely helpful and gave me a few ideas for where to go next with the process of creating my typeface generator. <br/>
- SVG to processing/ identify anchor points of all possible typefaces then randomly select anchorpoints and combine to create each character.

- Breziers to connect anchor points with a clean curve.
