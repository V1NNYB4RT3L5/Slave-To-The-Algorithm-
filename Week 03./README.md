# Week 3.
In week 3 we focused on non-human collaboration, ways of making marks by directing or capturing non-human behaviour.<br/>
### Margie Livingston
Margie collaberates with the terrain on which she walks, harnessing a sometimes pre painted or blank canvas from her backpack that drags facedown behind her. A good explanation of her [process](https://www.visualartsource.com/index.php?page=editorial&pcID=17&aID=4981)<br/>

### Patricio Gonzalez - vPlotter
Patricio's [plotter](http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/process.php) is based on Alexander Weber's [Der Kritzler](https://tinkerlog.com/2011/09/02/der-kritzler/), 'This version used an Arduino to control the steppers' drivers and servo motors. This Arduino was receiving instructions from an OpenFrameworks application I coded through the USB serial port.'- Paatricio Gonzalez. His original idea was to use the plotter to draw with great precision but after facing some difficulties he decided to use it instead as a bridge between analog and digital.<br/>

### Harvey Moon
Harvey Moon uses similar plotting machines to Gonzales for his work [Bugs Draw for Me.](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/gvwxvm/robot-art-harvey-moons-drawing-machines) in this case he uses a camera which tracks the movement of the bug and the plotter follows it drawing the path of the bug. <br/>

### Leonel Moura
Possibly slightly off topic but I enjoyed the look of this work, [Viral Vital Energy.](http://www.leonelmoura.com/viral-vital-energy/) Leonel Moura's part in this peice involves a process of generative design,'The model of the sculpture with its radiating shape was created by an algorithm which once given a 3D sphere generates spikes and holes on it. Some constraint parameters, such as the maximum size of the spikes and holes, are introduced previously, but the creative process is essentially generative and not controlled.'<br/>

## Unplugged Activity - Nonhuman Drawing. 
For my nonhuman drawing I attached the end of a paint brush to the string connected to a hellium balloon, I confined the space of which the helium balloon could move and then directed a fan at it to imitate wind. The results are as follows, Pink paint for slowest fan speed, blue paint for middle fan speed and yellow paint for highest fan speed. <br/>
