# Week 8.
Week 8 began with an update from everyone on where they were at. I presented my pseudo code - <br/>

I had began to try and figure out how to make this system in Processing. I played around with loading in an example letter as an image and trying to manipulate the array of pixels by only allowing a select section to appear but I was having no luck. My next attempt was to have a look into works created using the [Geomerative Library](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/) created by Ricard Marxer that Karen had introduced me to. 

### Prototype survey screen.

Karen sugested that I look into transferring tabular data to processing, allowing me to create a spreadsheet that associates all possible answers from the MyType survey questions to a typeface that processing can recieve information on depending on the users input. I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woaR-CJEwqc) which explains how CSV files can be used by processing to generate certain inputs. We also discussed Geomerative which I had been directed to in week 7. and had a look at this [example](http://generative-typografie.de/generativetypografie/bastard/) by Tobias Tschense generating font 'bastards' out of various parts of different fonts. there was alot of talk about [libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/#typography)<br/>

### Processing class. 

For our processing class we looked at speech in P5.js using this [extention](https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/) we were able to speak into our microphones and processing would turn that into words on our screen. <br/>
