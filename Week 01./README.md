# Week 1.
For week 1 of Slave To The Algorithm we began by growing an undestanding of what Parametric and Generative Design is, looking at a variety of designers creating a variety of different styles of works from moving visuals to 3D architectural structures. In order to strengthen this understanding we compared it to our every day life and parametric systems such as making breakfast where there lies multiple sets of variables that we go through in order to reach the final result. We then participated in an activity called parametric drawing where we would create several different variables and 6 different possibilites for each that were then selected by the roll of a dice. Going through this excersize really solidified what the procedure of parametric design is. Finally we began our work on this, our new GiHub accounts. 
## Week 1 Research. 
*Here are some of designers we learnt about during our introduction to parametric/generative design that happened to catch my eye.*<br/>

**David Szakaly**<br/>
I find David’s work really enjoyable to look at, the kind of visuals that would go well with music, something that doesn’t really have to have any real story behind it but instead just looks nice. I think that’s why Karen referred to his work as instagram friendly, as with an audience of people scrolling the work must be short and sharp. He seems to refer to a program called Houdini a lot which would be interesting to look into.<br/>

**Ryoji Ikeda**<br/>
I found the work of Ryoji Ikeda extremely immersive and unlike the work of David Szakaly it relies much more on the environment that it is presented in. When exhibiting ‘*The Radar*’ on a beach in Rio De Janeiro Ikeda explained how without the human interaction with his work and the sound and movement of the waves against the shore the work was not complete.<br/>

**Andreas Angelidakis**<br/>
Some really awesome work on his blog, mostly architural, I really enjoy the pixelated quality of his rendering. Struggling to find what of his work is parametric or generative design though.<br/>

**David Klein**<br/>
Example of parametric typography that I think is really great. Depending on the time some of the variations can look really cool but I wonder if you were shown the typeface without knowing the story behind why it looks the way it does if it would still be an attractive typeface. Computer generated typefaces.<br/>

No regrets.<br/>
## Week 1 Activity - Parametric Drawing.  
Here I created 4 different characteristics colour, shape, canvas shape and line type with 6 variations within each (apologies for the orange and yellow being quite faint).<br/>
