# Week 10.
My next step was to apply my progress so far to a sketch that actually invited the users interaction. <br/>

The biggest issue I found in my most developed sketch was that regardless of being the same fontSize the letters were different sizes and not stacking up in a way that would allow them to be combined how I desired them to. In order to fix this I gave each array of points a specific font size and location that would allow them all to sit within the same set of boundaries.

Next I decided to go with the button function and allocated a different colour for the different arrays of points to allow the user to differentiate between the letters. So far I had still not worked out how the points were going to be merged in processing so I added an example created in illustrator as an image to create a prospective view of my typeface generator. Aside from some sizing issues based on components not being sensitive to screen size the sketch worked as planned.<br/>
