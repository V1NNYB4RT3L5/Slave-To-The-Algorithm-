# Week 5. 
## Pitch Presentations. 
[My Pitch.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dFQ54Z3aR--PmsU-psM7W7nJTbhHi51xY2YPijYLimQ/edit?usp=sharing)<br>
MyType.
A typeface generator that receives its parameters from personal characteristics and interests.
The process begins with your input of answers to a series of questions about yourself, creating a combination of answers that is completely unique to you. These answers are then associated with parameters that will form your typeface. 
## Findings during the making of my pitch.
### MIT Media Lab Logo. 
Created by [Studio Thegreeneyl](http://www.thegreeneyl.com/) in collaboration with [E Roon Kang](http://www.eroonkang.com/projects/MIT-Media-Lab-Identity/), this [MIT Media Lab]([https://www.media.mit.edu/) visual identity has 45,000 variations. A custom web interface was developed in order to allow any member of the media lab to create and claim their very own shape. This work was appealing to me when in the process of figuring out how to create a unique typeface for each individual who uses my typeface generator, leading me to an idea of stacking prexisting typefaces on top of one another and sitting them on a grid then allocating different squares of the grid to different typefaces. <br/>

### Metaflop.
[Metaflop](https://www.metaflop.com/), founded by Alexis Reigel and Marco Muller, is a web-based graphical user interface allowing non-programmers to adjust the parameters of a metafont to their desire. This begins with the master metafont which in this case here is bespoke, the user can then manipulate its anatomy creating their very own typeface by using the sliding bars to set their parameters for each characteristic. I used this as an example as I thought of possibly associating all possible answers to my typeface generator survey questions with a metaphont parameter value. <br/>

 . [collection](http://generativetypography.com/) of generative typography by Kyuha Shim. (video) <br/>

at this stage the processes behind these examples of generative typography havn't had a great influence on me however the abstract styles definitely have.
