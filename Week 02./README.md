# Week 2. 
After having a brief look into some of the 12 hour challenges that had been set for homework where I personally used the flip of a coin to go through a series of decisions around the topic of dinner, we began looking into the world of processing. Looking at early examples of algorithmic art from people such as Sol Lewitt and Manfred Mohr where sets of rules were created at first to be comprehended by humans and then eventually by computers.<br/>
### Manfred Mohr
Here is an early example of Manfred Mohr's work from 1976-77 [Cubic Limit II](http://www.emohr.com/ww4_out.html). To my understanding in this work he has a cube on either side of the centre line that are both rotating independently and any lines that are framed within the central square which is a cube projected at 0,0,0 degrees will be thicker.<br/>

Here is a later work from 2002-2004 [Space.Color.Motion](https://vimeo.com/145946715). This was an addition to his work Space.Color which was his transition into using colour in his work. This program chooses 6-d random angles and increments based on the present time and date determining the substructure and colour range.<br/>

### ...
We then dove into our first processing lesson, and after learning a few simple tricks such as creating **lines**, **ellipses**, **rectangles**, and giving them **colour** and/or **stroke**, or making their position or colour dependent on the **position of the mouse**, we were asked to create a self portrait. <br/>

I then remixed Louis' portrait, allowing his right eye to rotate and his hair to colour according to the location of the mouse when it is clicked. <br/>
